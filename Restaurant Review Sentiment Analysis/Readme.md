Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP



This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that analyzes restaurant reviews and predicts whether the sentiment is *Positive* or *Negative* using Machine Learning.

It uses TF-IDF Vectorizer for text feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.  
A simple web interface is built using Streamlit.

 Features:
 
- Accepts user input review text
  
- Predicts sentiment as Positive or Negative
  
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
  
- Uses real restaurant review dataset (TSV file)
  
- End-to-end NLP + ML project

---

 Technologies Used:
 
- Python
  
- Pandas
  
- Scikit-learn
  
- Streamlit
  
- Pickle
  
- NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)

 How It Works :
1. Load dataset from TSV file
   
2. Preprocess text using TF-IDF Vectorizer
   
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
   
4. Save trained model using Pickle
   
5. User enters a review in web app
 
6. Model predicts Positive or Negative sentiment
  
7. Result is displayed on screen
